  "result": "ld versions of SPSS limited string variables to a width of 255 bytes. For backward compatibility with these older versions, the system file format represents a string longer than 255 bytes, called a very long string, as a collection of strings no longer than 255 bytes each. The strings concatenated to make a very long string are called its segments; for consistency, variables other than very long strings are considered to have a single segment.A very long string with a width of w has n = (w + 251) / 252 segments, that is, one segment for every 252 bytes of width, rounding up. It would be logical, then, for each of the segments except the last to have a width of 252 and the last segment to have the remainder, but this is not the case. In fact, each segment except the last has a width of 255 bytes. The last segment has width w - (n - 1) * 252; some versions of SPSS make it slightly wider, but not wide enough to make the last segment require another 8 bytes of data.Data is packed tightly into segments of a very long string, 255 bytes per segment. Because 255 bytes of segment data are allocated for every 252 bytes of the very long string’s width (approximately), some unused space is left over at the end of the allocated segments. Data in unused space is ignored.Example: Consider a very long string of width 20,000. Such a very long string has 20,000 / 252 = 80 (rounding up) segments. The first 79 segments have width 255; the last segment has width 20,000 - 79 * 252 = 92 or slightly wider (up to 96 bytes, the next multiple of 8). The very long string’s data is actually stored in the 19,890 bytes in the first 78 segments, plus the first 110 bytes of the 79th segment (19,890 + 110 = 20,000). The remaining 145 bytes of the 79th segment and all 92 bytes of the 80th segment are unused.The very long string record explains how to stitch together segments to obtain very long string data. For each of the very long string variables in the dictionary, it specifies the name of its first segment’s variable and the very long string variable’s actual width. The remaining seg",

      "—Daniel Cherny",

      "The Test is just the third day-night Test at the Gabba and the first since 2019. Ordinarily the Adelaide Test is the sole pink-ball clash for the home Test summer but a scheduling quirk meant Adelaide hosted a day Test last week.",
      "Starc – who took four wickets on day one to go past 350 in Test cricket – said the pitch, which had just 3mm of grass covering, was not optimal for a day-night clash.",
      "“We knew it was gonna be a little bit in with a hard new ball. It’s a pretty good wicket. We know the pink balls get soft at some point and I think that the firmness of this wicket, it started to go soft about the 11th over,” Starc said.",
      "“The ball is what it is. I think it now comes down to the wicket which I think Adelaide’s got right because of the ball and we know it goes soft at certain stages depending on the wicket I think there’s a certain cushion to what they make in Adelaide and just why it’s been such a good Test match, the pink ball Test in Adelaide. ",
      "“So I think this week is pretty similar to the game we played Pakistan here with the pink ball (in 2016). In that game as well it went soft very early. There was a lot of dead patches where because it was so soft. It was hard to score, there wasn’t much in it for the bowlers and I think Pakistan got about 450 chasing 490 in the fourth innings so it feels a bit like a similar wicket where it’s probably a bit too firm for the pink ball. I think it’d be a fantastic red ball wicket but probably too firm for the pink ball.”",
      "Off-spinner Lyon offered similar sentiments when speaking after play on the ABC.",
      "“I’ll try not to get in trouble,” Lyon said. This is just my opinion. The right venue for pink ball Tests is Adelaide Oval and that’s because (of) the contest between bat and ball and the grass left on the wicket. This wicket, I think it would be a brilliant red-ball wicket.”",

      "Usman Khawaja highlighted how Australia had moved seamlessly into the post-David Warner era by taking a fine, high catch at what had been Warner’s position of first slip. Kirk McKenzie departed for 21 from 25 balls after the left-hander slashed at a delivery from Cummins.",
      "Carey should be particularly grateful for the take given the edge was going between him and the Khawaja. Any chance heading inside first slip is regarded as the keeper’s catch.",

A rare misfield from Labuschagne at mid-off allows Sinclair to pick up another two runs to make it 10 from the over. Starc looks far from impressed.",

Martin Pegan here to guide you through the first half of what looms as a cracking day, while Jim Wallace will later steer you to stumps.We have a contest on our hands thanks to West Indies pair Josh Da Silva (79) and Kavem Hodge (71), who came together with their side reeling at 64-5. A patient 149-run, 311-ball partnership rebuilt the innings and allowed the visitors to finished day one with a respectable total of 266-8.Mitchell Starc (4-68) did much of the damage to the West Indies’ top order while becoming just the fifth Australian bowler to reach 350 Test wickets. The left-arm quick will be eyeing off the remaining lower order to clinch a 15th five-wicket haul in Test cricket.While Australia will of course want to wrap up the West Indies’ innings as quickly as possible, it will be interesting to see how they approach the chase following the whirlwind debut from Shamar Joseph and with Tropical Cyclone Kirrily having crossed the coast in north Queensland."
